    "text":"I constantly see people talking about this. I \\*personally\\* think it's a fearmongering tactic that is really unhealthy to be pushing on the younger generation (which I am a part of).\n\nWhen you look at the industrial revolution, people were totally against the mass use of machinery because it was \"taking all the jobs\". They were also against a lot of some the other advancements at the time. Some jobs may have gone away because of this, but many more were created as a means to help continue advancing society.\n\nI really feel like this is the same thing that will happen with AI. Of course AI will replace some jobs, but will it seriously not create any? There are SO many things that AI simply can't do.\n\nThe first sentence is my opinion and I'm coming here to ask what everyone thinks and get some insight as to whether or not my opinion might be blind to reality. I'm not trying to attack the opinion of anyone who disagrees. Just want some thoughts.\n\n  \nEdit: I should add that I'm talking about in the years ahead of now. Let's go 10 years out. I understand it's taking jobs now, but unemployment went up during the industrial revolution. ",

    "text":"Started my BA (Business Analyst) job search back in October while still in school. It was an on-and-off process until the end of May when I finally got an offer. In total, I applied to over 1,000 positions, got 19 interviews, and eventually accepted an offer from a Tier 3 consulting firm doing data-focused BA work.\n\nThe hardest part wasn\u2019t my resume or skills \u2014 it was how draining the process was. Job boards, resume tweaks, endless applications\u2026 I was spending at least 2 hours a day just on repetitive tasks, and it really wore me down.\n\nHere are a few things that helped me stay on track:\n\n\u2705 Be intentional when searching\nInstead of randomly scrolling through jobs, I built a system. I split my search into two sets of keywords:\n\nSkills: SQL, Tableau, stakeholder communication\n\nIndustries: healthcare, public sector, non-profit\nThen I used these combos to reverse-search for roles that fit.\n\n\u2705 Structure your interview prep (don\u2019t just memorize answers)\nFor behavioral interviews, I broke my past projects into STAR stories and reused a small set of well-prepared examples. It made interview prep much more manageable and authentic.\n\n\u2705 Automate the boring stuff\nLater in the process, I started using Correlate AI to auto-fill applications and get tailored job recs. It saved me a ton of time, especially for Workday listings (one-click apply!). I used that extra time to focus on interview prep and researching companies.\n\nOverall, BA roles tend to have longer hiring cycles and put more weight on soft skills and business context. My advice: start early \u2014 don\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve finished all the Leetcode to explore your direction.\n\nThe market is still very competitive, but with the right tools and a good pace, the whole process becomes a lot more sustainable.",

    "text":"Honestly, job searching has been completely hell for me these past few months. Majority of jobs require experience and even some walk-ins attempts I tried, they tell you that you have to go apply online. For people getting started in the workplace like me, this makes getting started difficult. I have no work experience and than some positions view me as overqualified because of my current credentials (Already obtained a STEM related degree and now currently in college for a bachelors in marketing). I simply been searching for a job to make some money over the summer, but I am getting ghosted from everywhere and this includes fast food jobs or even cashier positions. Applying online has not been helpful especially with the systems requirements to say certain keywords to filter people out. Like it\u2019s not even only that I am getting ghosted but I am not even getting a simple rejection, like absolutely NO RESPONSE. I am also dealing with ADHD, Anxiety and more mental health issues that I been maneuvering with and still willingly pushing through with in college thanks to the help of accommodations, and next semester I am enrolled to take 5 classes so working a job while taking 5 classes is way to much for me to juggle, even my family agreed that would be to much to do. So it\u2019s not even like I am searching for permanent work. I feel the job market for people will only get worse in the future, and we already heard about the rise of AI doing certain jobs and how more companies are going to lean on AI for work due to convenience and saving money (even though in my personal opinion I do not feel AI can successfully replace every single job, but I will discuss that topic later on). But how exactly is Gen Z supposed to get into the workplace if they aren\u2019t even being given the opportunity to build real world experience? I feel even the skills I have are being overlooked before I can even prove myself because I am not being given the opportunity to bring my talents to the table.\n\nIt\u2019s actually crazy to me hearing my parents talk about getting a job being as simple as walking in and talking to someone to get hired when they were my age, and it\u2019s like the older people in my family put pressure on me to just simple get a job which obviously isn\u2019t as easy as whatever they where experiencing back than. I came to a point where honestly, I have job searching fatigue at this point and don\u2019t have the energy to keep searching for jobs in such a small town with limited options. Even if suggested I get a job through school connections, my school is in NYC and I have to travel from upstate to NYC to stay in the dorms for the semesters. I can\u2019t get a job through school connections for summer position or temporary work in upstate.\n\nIs any other college students going through this issue with job searching? Or does anyone have any advice on how to pull specifically temporary or summer positions? \n\nDo you think part of the issue could also be that I am in a small town currently? For anyone specifically who lives in NYC, is getting a job as challenging, or possibly less? Maybe I am aiming for work in the wrong location and that is playing a part in my struggle. ",

I typically use LinkedIn, Indeed, or the company website. I'm in the U.S., but have applied to jobs both in and out of the country if they're willing to hire.\n\nWith over 300 applications, I've gotten a whole two phone interviews. One went on for three rounds before getting ghosted. The other was nice enough to send a rejection email after the 1st round. I tried reaching out to both to ask if anything stood out or was lacking in my interview to hopefully get a better idea for my next interviews, but never heard back.\n\nGhost job listings are a real problem. I try to keep an eye out for new listings (instead of reposts) or using the company's website to ensure that they're hiring. I've gotten scam emails about jobs and when I call the company, they aren't even hiring. \n\nI know the job market is a competitive place, my experience isn't really the strongest, and AI seems to be taking over a lot of the copywriting roles.

Otherwise, I would not commit to such distances...\n\nSo this is the technology which is replacing people or the humanity in the experiences. \n\nBut my question is not about all technology, but strictly, how many of you, or cases that you know in your company, that made people loose their job because of AI?\n\nThey speak a lot that AI replaced many and it is at the cause of some layoffs, but didn't see actual examples of them speaking their personal story to, understand fully the scale of the situation.\n\nSo I guess this is your chance to share of you... maybe someone you know, or from your work.\n\nI see the AI getting stronger with every quarter of the year.

(this is a long one, mostly a rant, but also asking advice)\n\ni was the first person hired to specialize in social media, which meant constantly having to prove my value and fight for boundaries and respect. i created SOPs to define my role and streamline processes for social deliverables, but coworkers regularly bypass them and do my job. Leadership acknowledged in the past that this has been an issue since \"before i got here\" but has yet to resolve it.\n\nthe agency has grown a lot in the past year - leadership has expanded but not improved. sadly one of our VPs passed this year, which I feel has caused the company to lose direction. toxic dynamics have gone unchecked especially a \"mean girl\" duo whose behavior drove out a new hire a few months ago. she got iced out bc she confided in her director that she didn't like mean girl #1's teaching and behavior (micromanage-y). that director straight up told the mean girl, thus causing the duo to give new girl the cold shoulder.\n\nleadership begged her to stay, then \"accepted\" her resignation a few days later. then the mean girl who'd trained her got promoted a few weeks later. **reward toxic behavior? check.**\n\nthat director recently leaked my concerns too when i asked my director to help enforce the SOP. the two of them spoke and then Loose Lips told the account team that i was feeling \"unappreciated\". (not what i had said). **management w\/ no people or management skills? check.**\n\na few weeks ago, 3 people were laid off. 2 of them were struggling but neither got the support they needed. both were going thru personal stuff and often criticized by the previously mentioned mean girls. the third had big shoes to fill when she was hired last fall and was unfairly compared to her predecessor. leadership said it was \"slow business\"... **layoffs w\/ no clear explanation? check.**\n\nsince then, things have gotten worse. some coworkers are openly disregarding my role again \u2014 even seeming to celebrate the layoff of our copywriter so they could do copy themselves. meanwhile, i've pushed for months for us to address AI use, especially since clients are using it poorly and it\u2019s affecting our work. only now is leadership finally discussing a policy. and we always say we're cutting edge and the leading agency in the state.\n\nlast week, they gathered everyone to start planning for the agency's 30th anniversary later this year. leadership was tossing around messaging ideas from \"our clients love us so much\" to \"i love my job here at XYZ agency.\" **tone deaf? check.**\n\ni don't feel seen anymore or valued, and i'm doing the bare minimum to get through each day. too much has happened i can no longer convince myself i can last until it gets better. my current director and the one that stepped up after our VP passed have been really supportive but i fear it's not enough . they're the only ones i worry about when it comes to who i'll impact when i leave.\n\ni'm currently job hunting, ideally out of agency life and away from social media. i'm emotionally checked out and tempted to quit the second i get an offer, but i'm a bit conflicted... i don't want to burn bridges especially when the marketing world is small here, everyone knows everyone. i might come back to the industry eventually.\n\nstill, i'm not sure i can deal w\/ 2 more weeks of tension and probably some cold shoulders. i know i'd be making a statement wanting to leave right after the layoffs. but a petty part of me wants them to scramble when i do leave.\n\nplus, my other digital teammate is my backup and she's also considering leaving now that she had to absorb one of the laid off jobs w\/ no comp. if we both leave, it'd create a major gap. is it bad i almost want that? lol\n\nidk, maybe it's not as big a decision as i feel it is but i'm a recovering people pleaser and overthinker LOL. am i not crazy in wanting to dip ASAP even if i lose any chance of rehire or being \"blacklisted\" in some way? what would you guys do - secure a new job and quit immediately? give 2 weeks, maybe just 1?",

My main issue was timing as I finished college with a software degree two months into the pandemic of 2020 and had a graduate offer that was rescinded two weeks before the start date, all because of covid. My life has stalled ever since as I had to move back home and the consecutive years have been a blur as it does not feel anywhere near 5 years, even saying 2 years doesn't feel right to me. Current job market is bad and is getting exponentially worse over time isn't helping either and I get quite existential about my future especially because of the AI bubble.\n\nNowadays, I run a farm in exchange for having my rent and bills paid although I don't earn a wage and am downright unemployed. My current situation works out better than a minimum wage job, but the fact I have no pension contributions and such really bothers me. Don't even have a reference or proof of doing farm work during this time either. Parents could, but they won't in case of tax implications (their words) and a reference from a family member is assumably worthless.\n\nThe industry my qualification is in is still dreadful and having no relevant work experience since graduating is making me unhireable to be honest. I have worked on software projects throughout the years which interviewers have showed interest in and have continued studying even though it feels like I'm just wasting more time to the void by doing this. Made it to the final round numerous times, but its all pointless how far you get unless you receive an offer.\n\nI should be fairly deep into a prosperous career by now, but I am in the same position as I was before I started college, if not worse as I'm not that young anymore. Every morning I wake up with a pit in my stomach seeing what my life has become. It's very discouraging knowing that everyone else I know has a job in the field they studied, but of course I don't. The logical choice would be to move away from software but in reality, there's nothing else I want to do as I had my mind set on it as a career and still do to this day.",

    "text":"Hi guys,\n\nSo backstory, I\u2019m 30 years old and recently graduated late last year with a bachelor\u2019s in data analytics. Since graduating, I\u2019ve been trying to break into the field with no luck. I\u2019ve applied to over 160 jobs just in the past month and only landed 3 phone screens, none of which moved forward.\n\nRecently, my wife saw a job posting at her company that matched my field and forwarded my resume to the manager of that position. She doesn\u2019t know them personally or anything, just figured it was worth a shot. Somehow, that actually led to a phone screen, and now I\u2019ve got a \u201cbehavioral and job-specific\u201d interview in just a few days.\n\nI looked up the job, and despite the listing saying there were \"100+\" applicants, I somehow got through the phone screen and scheduled for the interview all in the span of a single day. Sadly, this interview is the closest I\u2019ve ever been to starting a real data career, and I\u2019m both excited and freaking out. I\u2019ve only had two interviews in my life, and both were for warehouse grunt floor job so this is a whole new level.\n\nEver since I got the interview, I\u2019ve been in full panic study mode. I\u2019ve been spending about 9 hours a day reviewing SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and re-reading the job description like it\u2019s an exam study guide. I\u2019ve been watching YouTube videos on analyst interviews, doing mock interviews with AI, and even trying to cram a bit during work hours at my current job just to get some extra reps in.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019m an absolute mess during interviews. I sound like some mix between Donald Trump without the confidence and a sleepy old man trying to tell a long story. I \"um\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d like crazy and sometimes I\u2019ll say the same thing three different times in three different ways in case the first two didn\u2019t sound nervous enough.\n\nI\u2019ve also been battling some heavy low confidence & imposter syndrome. My current job doesn\u2019t relate to my degree at all, and I just had a baby in the past year, so I\u2019ve been stretched thin. And when I see \u201c100+ applicants\u201d on the job posting, I just assume everyone else has a master\u2019s, a polished portfolio, and actual analyst experience. The most I been doing at my job is visualizations but it's not like that's finding insights or anything. To add salt to the wound I'm already located in the Silicon Valley so that just about gives you an idea of the people I'm trying to compete against. I feel like I'm completely cooked.\n\nHonestly, I already feel embarrassed that the dashboard I listed on my resume was just a solo school project. Not even a capstone, just a basic class assignment. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, and I\u2019m pretty sure it screams rookie.\n\nI really want this job, not just for the title or the role, but because it would be lifechanging. I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life making garbage pay and quietly battling depression, wondering if I\u2019d ever get out of it. Going back to school was a huge risk, and this would be the first sign that it wasn\u2019t all for nothing. The job pays around $69K, and while I know that\u2019s low for a lot of people here, but it would completely change my and my family\u2019s life. I know some of you make $120K+ and beyond, but for me, this is my shot at actual stability and finally getting into the field.\n\nIf anyone has tips for behavioral or technical interviews (especially for analyst roles), what kinds of questions to expect, or would even be willing to mock interview me, it\u2019d mean the world.\n\nThank you. I\u2019m doing my best, but nerves are absolutely winning right now. I\u2019m trying to expect the worst but hope for the best. I know putting all my eggs in one basket for a single interview is a terrible idea and probably even worse for my nerves, but it\u2019s hard not to. It\u2019s hard to believe this ISN'T my one shot, because it really is.\n\ntldr; late grad trying to break into data analytics after 160+ rejections. Got a surprise interview thanks to wife. I\u2019ve been cramming like crazy but struggling with nerves, imposter syndrome, and interview anxiety. This job would be life-changing for me and my family. Would love any advice or mock interview help.",

Some worked, some didnt, but at the end it saved me so much time i don\u2019t know why i didn\u2019t do it earlier.\n\n**your resume isn\u2019t a biography, it\u2019s a billboard**  \nrecruiters are skimming. they\u2019re not reading. if you don\u2019t hook them in the first 7 seconds, they move on.  \nevery bullet point should answer one question: why does this help me do this job  \nuse action > result > proof. no fluff.\n\n**track your process or you\u2019ll spiral**  \ni used to apply and forget where i applied. then get stressed because i \u201cwasn\u2019t doing enough.\u201d  \nturns out i *was* doing enough, i just wasn\u2019t tracking it.  \ni started logging every app in a google sheet:  \ncompany  \njob title  \ndate applied  \ndid i follow up?  \ndid i hear back?  \nthis sounds basic but it kept me from losing my mind. it also helped me see when things were actually moving forward (even when it felt like nothing was happening). Also this takes some time, so dont be inpatient.\n\n**interviewing is a skill you have to practice**  \ni bombed my first 3 interviews because i thought they\u2019d just \u201cget me\u201d if i was myself.  \nnah. interviewing is like a mini performance. you have to practice your answers out loud, even if it feels weird.  \ni literally recorded myself answering \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d 10 times until it didn\u2019t suck anymore.\n\n**burnout will sneak up on you if you don\u2019t pace yourself**  \nthere were days i applied to 15+ jobs. by the end of the week i hated my laptop, my career, and myself.  \nnow i do 3 to 5 solid apps a day max. quality over quantity. then i log off and go outside. but then again, it depends on which job sector you are in.\n\n**last thing: nobody has this figured out**  \nthe people hiring you? stressed. the recruiter? overworked. your friends who \u201cgot lucky\u201d? they probably felt just as lost before they landed something.  \nyou\u2019re not failing. you\u2019re just stuck in the messy middle like everyone else.\n\nkeep going. you\u2019re closer than you think.",

The lady who helped me was kinda... attractive ngl. Like the way she laughed on the phone was so cute bro (this is besides the point).\n\nAnyways, the staffing agent lady pretty much alley-oop'd me a position at Fedex for a data entry role. The whole process was pretty much like this:\n\n1. Staffing lady calls me on the phone\n2. Email back and forth\n3. Take-home data entry assessment (very easy, most of u guys could pass)\n4. I pass the assessment (obviously it was so easy)\n5. She sends me a direct referral link for Fedex (i think thats what it was)\n6. I fill out a bunch of forms\n7. Offer letter emailed to me, this is so simple...\n\nSomething I didn't mention is that a lot of companies are starting to adopt AI. One of the websites they used is something called Paradox AI and you'll notice a common name (Olivia).\n\nFedex had pretty much nothing to do with the hiring process. It was basically the cute staffing agent lady from Manpower and Olivia (a robot) from Paradox AI.\n\nHere's the thing tho... The pay range was $16.50\/hr - $23.00\/hr.\n\nSince the entire process had nothing to do with Fedex itself, I couldn't even negotiate the pay.\n\nWhat should I do guys? I can't take $16.50\/hr bro.

    "text":"I\u2019m a recent grad who\u2019s been working since 18, being lucky enough to get 4 years of experience in marketing and content strategy\/ copywriting. I think the mixed nature of my experience across freelance, part-time time and full-time, as well as overlapping roles (due to freelancing) is a red flag. I have no problem getting interviews- however, I do feel I should be getting more than I am. It just seems that when I reach the final stage interviews they start questioning and nitpicking my experience and how it all worked alongside uni and the overlapping timelines- they even seem confused. \n\nThe truth is, I had to fund my way through university as I have no parents or familial support. Instead of working in a part-time hospitality or retail job as many of my friends did I decided to get my foot in the door and get myself some corporate experience. This looked like freelancing and working part-time across term times and then full-time work over the course of the 6-month-long summers and a gap year that I took. This was also made largely possible by the fact that my roles were all remote. \n\nI managed to build experience and get promoted across two roles (one part-time and one freelance but on retainer to an agency) quickly, partly due to my desperation to succeed and also due to the fact that these were smaller companies (think 5-15 employees) with flatter hierarchy structures. I think this also looks like a red flag without context- or from at least how a recent interviewer acted (refused to believe I had the level of roles I had). \n\nI even had an interviewer question how I was able to complete a degree at a top 20 globally ranked university whilst working so much. It made me feel quite frustrated, to be honest and like valuable interview time was being wasted on questions about my work ethic and the juggling act that was uni. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m not sure what to do next. I\u2019m feeling really stuck. \n\nPlease tear my CV apart and let me know exactly what\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s ATS-friendly and if I\u2019m correct in thinking HR or interviewers are thinking it looks suspicious for a recent grad.

    "text":"Sorry for the long read but I would appreciate your feedback. I'm semi retired now and want to try and help. I'm really glad I'm not job hunting right now.\n\nRecently a couple of people that are really close to me have lost their jobs. They are really struggling to get back into the workforce. \n\nWhile I was trying to help them, I did some searching on Reddit for ideas and noticed heaps (and heaps) of people are losing their jobs right now. In the news they say a lot of it is because of AI and cutbacks etc. I'm also seeing a lot of people are leaving school and unable to get their first job (no experience and no roles available)\n\nAnyway, my son in law is in his late 40's and is overqualified for most jobs or doesn't even get an interview because there are so many applicants. He's getting quite desperate. He's had to dumb down his CV from director of sales to sales manager to even get interviews. It's quite rough out there, and everything I read indicates it's going to get worse.\n\nIn my past life, I used to write online courses for a living (think corporate training, onboarding stuff, skill-building, stuff). I've also been quite successful in a couple of businesses.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been toying with the idea of using my course-building brain to build something that might be able to help people. I think I can get some local government support or sponsorship so I can make it free. (I'm not trying to sell you anything. I haven\u2019t even set up a website)\n\nThe format I've been thinking about:\n\n\\- A short newsletter every few days with practical tips, ideas, and help (not preachy)\n\n\\- Maybe I could make some mini bite-sized courses as I go (things you can actually use, not influencer BS)\n\nAnyway, I'm super open to feedback on what would be most helpful. I just want to build something that can help people.\n\nI've had a few ideas on what would be most useful.\n\n1. Financial First-Aid: how to stop financial bleeding after a job loss. Stuff like how to cut costs, negotiate bills\/mortgage etc, and build a micro-budget to survive.\n\n2. Job Search: how to stand out when 500 people apply. I'm thinking refocusing resume for an AI world, how to network, and scripts you can use. Also, things to get past the ATS black hole.\n\n3. Micro-Income ideas in the Meantime: stuff you can do this week to make a little money. I'm not talking 7-figure business startup BS. Just some practical things that might add up and help you get by.\n\n4. Solo Skills: maybe you can take something you already know and package it into a service for local gigs, tutoring, consulting, etc.\n\n5. AI Basics: not another guru course. Just enough to help you improve a CV, tweak a cover letter, or prep for interviews with AI help without getting flagged by those resume scanners. Also, enough to ensure that you come across as AI proficient for your next role. (Applying it in a real job environment)\n\n6. (Maybe) : something more reflective that helps you figure out what\u2019s next when you can't get a job. Just to keep the momentum and mindset right.\n\n7. And for the sales people (like my son in law): how to do fractional work (That's where you do doing 2\u20133 part-time roles instead of just one full-time job) In sales, it might mean that you are not on the payroll, but get paid based on performance by multiple companies at once (how to pitch it so it's no risk and no brainer for a company to take you on)\n\nSo before I jump in too deep without thinking, I wanted to know if other thought it might be worthwhile, and what would be most helpful right now. (I'm sitting on my hands, have the time, and I have contacts that can probably fund this for me)\n\nWould this help you? What would you actually want in something like this? Are there topics I\u2019m missing?\n\nI really want to help people. Happy to chat in the comments or DM. No sales pitch coming after this. Just trying to do something to help people.\n\nThanks\n\nPS: I numbered the ideas I came up with so you can just comment with numbers (eg 1,6) if its easier. If you have better ideas I would love to know. (And if you have ideas for my son in law, that would be amazing too)",

They make more money by boosting the number of applicants irrespective of quality and fit, and whether or not the posting fills or not.\nSo she's getting around 10 out of 40 applicants being bots or with totally irrelevant experiences or totally irrelevant backgrounds.\n\nThere's always a couple applying with no intention of relocating, others missing language requirements, many programmers for non programming roles, many from blacklisted countries, many with trash resumes that are mindblowingly bad like not listing any jobs but have 10 years of experience, or 25+ certificates from unaccredited sources, or very clear AI slop for content on their profiles and resumes, or very clear identity theft\/impersonation but with many lazy af mistakes. These were all no-go criteria stated in the job description - these candidates didn't read.\n\nI'm mad at the state of things but employers are also struggling. It's a legit shit show with how much time is wasted because of how low the quality of candidates are. \n\nWhatever quality candidate you are, you're already amazing because you aren't \"spam\" candidates. Only issue is how to filter and discard the trash.\nSome of these spam applications are \"programmically smart\" like they're designed to fool AI recruitment tools but they're shit at passing human eyes, but even then they're a huge waste or everyone's time. One thing is these applications will write \"GPA 4.0\" or something garbage in white on white so it may help them bypass some tools but it will still get thrown out at the next stage. \n\nUnfortunately my partner's organization doesn't use these screening tools so they're really struggling under all the trash.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is recruitment and job seeking is a two way street. It actually does suck for everyone involved, employers too. Don't try to game the system, everyone looses when that happens.\n\nShe has tried to make it easy on candidates to apply but the result just isn't there. Is LinkedIn purposefully boosting applicant numbers say by running bots on their own platform? We may never know.\n\nShe's now adding arbitrary bureaucracy to weed out at least those that can't read and follow instructions, like to also email the resume as well as apply on LinkedIn. \n\nI've checked, her job descriptions are not unreasonable. \n\nThe process sucks but imo no one is out to ruin your life. Try to go into interviews and stuff with some positivity of helping each other find a match. Imo people can feel negativity, like if I didn't sleep well people can tell I'm tired and irritable.

Because I was applying to another job online yesterday and I saw this message: \u201c\u2026. employee who was impacted by the recent reduction is government funding\u2026 \u201c. \n\nDo my interviews keep fizzling out because so many government contracts and solicitations keep getting canceled and\/or frozen? \n\nIf it\u2019s that, what other career field could I pivot towards? I have a mortgage and I was making the lion\u2019s share of the money in my marriage so since I lost my job in March, our savings have taken an absolutely massive hit. I unfortunately can\u2019t start too \u201cat the bottom\u201d of whatever career I pivot towards since I have to pay our mortgage (and basically everything else) so what could I pivot towards with my education and experience background? That would at least be $70k+ annually?\n\nAny advice\/different perspective is greatly appreciated. My stress is at max levels and I just spent 4 hours applying to basically anything I can find online. Do I need another Shipley certification? Or APMP?\n\nP.S. it just occurred to me\u2026 is it the AI? The filtering AI that companies use now to siff through applications and resumes? Am I just not getting through the filtering system enough?",

It seems like that's all career coaches in the tech field want to do -- wordsmith and workshop application materials and maybe help gear them towards a particular job.  They might do interview practice and prep, but I interview well. (Hell, I even interview well with AI interviewers, or so says my Wellfound report.) What I'm finding feels geared towards early career, or even new to tech careers. I'm mid career, verging on senior.\n\nI want to find a career coach with an extensive network I can tap into, where they can put me in REAL interviews with REAL hiring managers, who have REAL jobs they are hiring for. I want to get non-AI feedback and get out of job seeking fast. I have a reasonable amount of money to spend on this, but not the 12k I was recently quoted by someone who further admitted they don't have a network in tech like this. This kind of coach exists in other disciplines, but I'm struggling to find even a solitary lead on a good tech coach for mid-to-late career techies.\n\nHelp?",

I work in manufacturing and I feel like more and more parts of my job could be replaced by AI or robots in the future. I\u2019m not super technical but I can see how fast things are changing, new softwares, machines that do more, AI that tracks stuff and finds mistakes faster than people.\n\nWhat I can\u2019t figure out is what happens to people like me in the middle. I\u2019m not on the shop floor all day but I\u2019m not high up management either. I guess I\u2019m like a middle manager, I help coordinate people, fix daily problems, check quality, and report up the chain.\n\nI worry AI might do parts of my job too, like making reports, tracking numbers, even planning shifts and stuff. But can AI really do the human parts? Like solving conflicts, motivating people, handling unexpected issues that pop up everyday?\n\nI don\u2019t really know how safe my job is in the long run. Should I be trying to move up? Or learn more tech skills? Or just focus on getting better at people management since AI might not do that well (yet)?\n\nAnyone else here in manufacturing feel the same? How are you dealing with it?

    "text":"Sorry wasn't sure how to word the title - but context is that I work for a pretty awesome AI Computer Vision company for Manufacturing\/Logistics operations, and I went to STEM only college in Indiana where 99% of my friends\/connections work in Manufacturing. I grew up listening to my dad on the phone talking to people asking to be connected with someone they know, or asking his friends if they'd entertain a meeting for where he was working at because it fits their role and more often than not it'd be a yes. If it was a no, generally it was because they already had something in house or were talking to someone else about it. I've tried talking to some friends, and it's mind boggling to me how aversive they are to even try and make an introduction -  not because they don't want to be involved or don't think it's their place - but because they're uncomfortable. If this sounds salesy and elitist, then I apologize because that's not the thought process of this. For this post I don't care about how to make it so they're more comfortable because I'm not in sales, but I just want to get an idea if others my age have experienced the same thing where just mentioning \"would love to hear about what you're doing and maybe have an informal chat about if there's an application we have that might help\" makes them get so uncomfortable and physically say \"ahhhh i don't know mannnnnnn\".\n\nIf you are that person who reacts that way - is there something i'm missing? And more importantly, for the people who maybe used to be that way - do you think it was an age\/experience thing and it took you some getting used to in order to be able to be comfortable in trying to introduce something new to either your place of work or make an introduction to someone you know?\n\nEdit: I know bringing up my dads experience isn't the same bc he was out of my age bracket, but I asked him when he started doing things like that - and to him, (he's been in Finance or fintech business forever) he didn't understand\/comprehend really that anything would be different because that's how it's been forever.

I worked in Bangalore, India. I've worked for major clients like Amazon Prime, Netflix, HBO Max, WB, Disney etc.\n* Current Location : Abu Dhabi, I'm on a Visit Visa and I'm staying with my parents.\n* Qualification : High School Diploma + Diploma in Audio Engineering\n* Current Goal : Find a Job in Abu Dhabi so I can stay with my parents and save up money and also get a degree through distant education. If I'm with my parents, I'll have support to study. I won't have to completely look after myself.\n* Roles I'm targeting : Data Entry, Office Admin, Sales, Document Control, Operations Assistant, Cashier, Audio Engineer.\n* Additional Certifications : I've done a Data Analytics Bootcamp from Coding Ninjas so I have knowledge in Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Python, SQL, Basic HTML, CSS etc.\n* Additional Interests : \n   * I also play piano, guitar and bass and I can produce music in DAW's. \n   * I'm proficient in many DAW's like Pro Tools, Ableton, Cubase, Studio One, FL Studio, Reaper etc. \n   * I also know how to edit videos using Premiere Pro. \n   * I'm also into AI. I've been trying out different AI tools like Ollama, Stable diffusion, Custom LoRa Training, Flux Models, Different prompting techniques with different LLM's etc.\n* Languages I'm good at : English, Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil.\n* I also wanted to go meet my gf in Thailand ( Before you ask : Yes she's actually a girl ). It's been 5 years. We met online and we've never met each other in person and I was never able to save money to go meet her which is also affecting me mentally.  \n\nChallenges I'm facing & what I've done so far:\n\n* Referrals play a major role in Abu Dhabi and unfortunately there is no one to refer me. Parents have been trying from their side but it's not working out. \n* I've tried applying mostly though Linkedin, Indeed and Career Websites. \n   * My findings : \n      * Most of them are ghost postings.\n      * I've been tailoring my resume for each job description using different AI tools like Google AI Studio, Gemini, Chat GPT, Job Owl Extension.\n      * I've tried using resume templates but they don't parse very well with ATS so I've been manually creating separate doc files for my resumes and I've been saving them to respective folders in my drive.\n      * I'm confident I have transferrable skills from my previous role which also included data entry, document control, skills to adapt to new software's and workflows very fast, good email etiquettes etc. in addition to the technical audio role.\n      * I've tried to be honest with my resume, I've also tried to fake it to bypass ATS when I started realizing how difficult it is to bypass ATS. \n      * I've tried tailored approaches and I've also tried mass applying approaches.\n      * I gave my resume to Lulu Hypermarket regional office (No Call back yet), I've also approached a few offices nearby my place and gave them my resume. (No Call backs).\n      * I've created an Upwork account for freelancing and bought some connects for bidding for work, but slowly realized that Upwork was almost like tinder. I never got a match for both and both apps kept asking me to boost my profile by paying them money. I've had better chances with tinder though.\n      * I've tried looking for VA jobs as well through reddit. Most of them were shady. \n      * I've also tried looking for other remote jobs but I think you all know how that might have went especially with my educational qualifications.\n      * I've also tried contacting some electronic retailer showroom like Sharaf DG but they ask if we have our own visa. My dad won't be able to sponsor a visa for me because I'm 25 which means I've crossed the age limit restriction in the UAE. \n      * I've also attended an interview at a music school but I didn't get the job because I was out of touch with my sight reading skills. \n   * Things I haven't done:\n      * I haven't gone out to the main city yet. It's just because most of the offices operate during the daytime from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM and the heat during that time is too bad. I feel dizzy just going out to get some tea. I think My parents are disappointed in me because of this.\n      * There's also a lot of schools in the area we stay. My mom has been suggesting me to approach these schools for any office related work. I'm not sure if this will work out because I don't have a degree.\n* Other Challenges:\n   * Dad's debt :\n      * Dad is in huge debt, however he's confident he can finish it in a few years but I'm not sure about that.\n   * Constant fight between parents :\n      * Mom and Dad are fighting all the time for even the smallest of things. I've been seeing them fight for a long time and from what I realize, they both require different people foundationally. They're expecting each other to be different people but I can guarantee it's not possible. \n      * I've been asking them to attend some therapy but they're not because of the expense. \n      * Basically both of them never understands each others strengths and weaknesses. She keeps on judging him for everything he does and he hurts her back by judging her back. Their problems are so deep that it's very difficult to achieve happy resolutions. \n      * They're 50 now and they need each other. These fights happen most of the time and then they get back together and the cycle just keeps on going. \n   * Baldness :\n      * The water in Abu Dhabi makes you go bald very fast and my dandruff and hairfall has increased a lot. \n* Alternate options :\n   * I can go back to India, Maybe Chennai. \n   * I have friends there and I can find a small job there but then I'll have to start from Zero again. I'm bad at taking care of myself. I also won't be able to save anything if I'm staying by myself especially with the salary I'll earn in India so I guess I'm stuck in Abu Dhabi for now.\n\n  \nWhat do you guys think I should do ?",
