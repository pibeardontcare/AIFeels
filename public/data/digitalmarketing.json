    "text":"Just sharing some tools I find endless value from for new marketers since I see a lot of posts on here about \u201chow do I get started, what should I learn, etc.\u201d\n\n**A little about me for context:**\n\n* Been marketing 15 years\n* Generalist with undergrad degree in psych (no formal marketing training)\n* Generated over $100M in my career\n* Currently leading a SaaS marketing team, but have worked in CPG too.\n* Have managed teams up to 15 people in size\n\nFeel free to share your tools below!\n\n* ***OneTab***\u00a0\\- Honestly this chrome extension changed my life. I\u2019m one of those people who keeps 47 tabs open, then feels stressed about having them open, but also stressed about closing them. OneTab allows me to get a fresh slate every morning without any concern about losing something.\n* ***Klaviyo***\u00a0\\- Without a doubt, Klaviyo is best marketing email platform for the money. The automation features are unbelievable and the integrations are really solid as well. To me, klaviyo brings big business segmentation and automation to small marketing teams in an easy to use interface with super transparent pricing.\n* ***GA4***\u00a0\\- K I actually hate GA4, but it is what it is. Learn this thing because you need it, like it or not. It\u2019s the standard.\n* ***Frizerly***\u00a0\\- Its a great AI agent that learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week! \n* ***Google ads***\u00a0\\- This is the first ads channel you should learn inside out. Mainly because it\u2019s the easiest one to find success with (because the technology is much better than any other ads platform, and because search ads capture intent instead of trying to capture interest). Between Google and YouTube, you\u2019ve got access to the majority of the internet with this one platform.\n* ***Asana***\u00a0\\- Absolutely love asana. The most intuitive and powerful project management system (also FREE). I\u2019ve tried jira, trello, Monday, notion, and clickup and they are all lackluster compared to asana when it comes to marketing project management. The functional advantages of subtasks, customizable tags, different options for views, messages and comments, attachments\u2026 this is the one system that actually works.\n* ***Noun project***\u00a0\\- There are so many underwhelming stock image sites. I really love this site. Most of my marketing graphics are either using icons or photos and noun project has the best selection for the best price, hands down. Also love that you can customize icons.\n* ***Google slides & Google sheets***\u00a0\\- Don\u2019t roll your eyes because most marketers I\u2019ve worked with aren\u2019t using half of the functionality these free tools offer. Namely, the ability to create a beautiful strategy deck that shows you thought about something and distilled it into a usable format for leadership and your team. But things like pivots, well made chart visuals, data formatting formulas, etc are all underutilized. Also, I\u2019d rather use sidewalk chalk than PowerPoint and excel.\n* ***Apollo***\u00a0\\- Cold emails are tough, but I think for the money you can\u2019t beat Apollo. It pulls in the stuff you typically have to pay a ton for like a huge database of contacts, recordable calls with transcripts and snippets, etc for a flat affordable monthly rate. Basically a mashup of zoominfo and gong for a fraction of the price of both. I will say: the data dashboards are absolutely horrible. Like unusable.\n* ***Loom***\u00a0\\- Can\u2019t tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I\u2019m taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos.\n* ***ChatGPT***\u00a0\\- Yeah we get it, AI is a thing and some of us hate it and some of us love it. Here\u2019s how I use this one: organizing a mess of notes into a coherent doc, drafting blog posts, generating customer avatars that I can ask questions, preparing for job interviews, negative keyword lists, and competitive analysis. There is a really good episode of Paid Search Podcast called \u201ctalking to your data\u201d that has cool ideas for parsing Google ads data with chatgpt as well. You just have to understand: 90% of the copy and ideas you get from ChatGPT is unusable trash. But the 10% is well worth it.\n* ***Reddit***\u00a0\\- lol. I mean, every time I have a question I can\u2019t find an answer to, I come here and ask, and I get answers. Sometimes on the most niche things. Aside from that, it\u2019s a fantastic listening tool. Jump into a forum and just look at what people say about the problem your business solves, your competitors, you, etc.\n* ***TinyPNG***\u00a0\\- Throughout my career, it\u2019s been a common theme that I get an image from a designer for an email and it\u2019s like 4.5mb. I love the emphasis on quality\u2026 but I\u2019m not going to bog my email down with that. Tinypng is free and almost always cranks the image down to a few KB without making it look like shit.\n* ***LinkedIn***\u00a0\\- I received 3 job offers in one month because I built a solid personal brand before I started looking for my most recent role. Yes, your connections (quantity and quality) do matter. Yes, it matters if you post on there actively. Additionally, it\u2019s (slightly) easier for me to book demos and spread awareness around whatever brand I\u2019m working on. I don\u2019t recommend premium or sales nav. No added value IMO.\n\nThose are the main ones. What about you?",

Way better than Sora by Open AI as well\n2. **Playground**: Great AI tool create graphic designs using marketing using AI without a graphic designer!\n3. **Frizerly:** The tool with the best AI features of all the SEO tools out there.  I personally love the feature where I can connect my Wordpress and it can auto publish blogs daily based on the keywords I have prioritized.\u00a0\n4. **Clay**: Great tool to automated outbound email and LinkedIn marketing. Essentially like Apollo but automated using AI\n5. **Plai**: Great too to A\/B test ads using AI. I love the concept and I am currently using it for Google ads.\n\nDid I miss your favorite it?

    "text":"Hi all- I have been in the SEO space for like 10 years and I mostly have always went with Semrush till last year for all my clients asking for SEO.\n\nHowever recently I found their UI\/UX to be really terrible and have been researching some alternatives. I also didn\u2019t like any of their AI features- they seem to have stagnated in innovation.\n\nSo I tried a bunch of different Semrush alternatives for SEO and here is my honest thoughts on the top 5 I personally liked in no particular order:\n\n1. **Ahrefs**:\u00a0A decent all-in one advanced SEO tool. I found Ahrefs very similarly to Semrush both in terms of pricing and usability. If you are not happy with Semrush, you are probably not going to be happy with Ahrefs. Like Semrush, this is a great tool for advanced SEO geeks and agencies managing multiple projects and want fine grained control over everything SEO.\n2. **Ubersuggests**: Ubersuggest is much cheaper than Ahrefs and Semrush but I personally did not like it at all.\n3. **Moz**: I personally really like Moz. It\u2019s slightly cheaper and I found their interface to be much cleaner than Ahrefs and Semrush. The only issue I had with Moz was, their AI integrations suck and if you are looking for AI stuff, this is not for you. If not, this would be the winner for me :)\n4. **Frizerly:** If you are an AI enthusiast\/early adopter and want to explore how AI can help with SEO, Frizerly is the tool for you. It doesn\u2019t offer as many advanced fine tuning stuff like Ahrefs\/Semrush. So its great for people who is aiming to get 80% results from 20% effort haha. I personally love the feature where I can connect my Wordpress and it can auto publish blogs daily based on the keywords I have prioritized. \n5. **Screaming Frog**: If you are looking for a tool with a great free version, go with Screaming Frog. For the free ones, this is be far the best. If you are willing to pay, not so much!\n\nAnd that\u2019s about it. I know this is a hotly debated\u00a0 topic. So if you disagree and have a different favorite tool,\u00a0 comment below. Happy to debate :)",

    "title":"Why I Won\u2019t Fake a Typo Just to Pretend It Wasn\u2019t LLM-Processed",
    "text":"Lately, I\u2019ve been watching a strange shift unfold on LinkedIn and across content teams: marketers avoiding hyphens like they\u2019re radioactive. Not because they forgot how to use them, but because they\u2019re afraid a dash too many will make their text look \u201ctoo polished\u201d \u2014 too AI-generated.\n\nAdd to that the flood of posts about the\u00a0MIT study \u201cYour Brain on ChatGPT\u201d\u00a0and sharp comments like this one from\u00a0Steffi Kieffer. All of it urging us to rely on common sense and our own brainpower first, not the machine.\n\nWe\u2019ve entered the uncanny valley of copywriting.\n\n# When the Medium Loses the Message\n\nYou see it on forums and Slack groups: people prompt ChatGPT to \u201cadd some typos,\u201d \u201crepeat a phrase or two,\u201d or \u201cmake it sound a bit less perfect.\u201d Why? To fool AI detectors \u2014 and people \u2014 into thinking it came straight from the keyboard.\n\nWe\u2019ve now built tools to\u00a0*generate*\u00a0content with AI,\u00a0*detect*\u00a0that AI-generated content, and then\u00a0*humanize*\u00a0it to avoid detection.\n\nWe\u2019re no longer writing for humans \u2014 we\u2019re writing for bots, detectors, and algorithms.\n\nAnd yes, I use AI tools. I love them. They help me brainstorm, rewrite, proofread, and compress. But if we spend more time prompting, re-prompting, and de-robotizing than actually thinking and writing, something\u2019s gone seriously wrong.\n\n# A Story of Hyphens (and How We Lost the Plot)\n\nOnce upon a time, in the golden age of copywriting, we could use em-dashes \u2014 for dramatic pauses \u2014 or hyphens for compound adjectives (like AI-powered tools) without second-guessing ourselves. Dashes gave our writing rhythm. Structure. Personality.\n\nOn social media, we\u00a0*couldn\u2019t*\u00a0use them for a while \u2014 most platforms didn\u2019t support formatting. But now, with content copied from LLMs, we\u00a0*can*. So why not?\n\nBecause today? Hyphens look suspicious. Dashes are considered AI giveaways. And God forbid you use a semicolon.\n\nSo people strip punctuation \u2014 not for style, but for plausible deniability.\n\n# Making Mistakes on Purpose \u2260 Authenticity\n\nThis reminds me of early SEO. We stuffed keywords in white text on white backgrounds and copy-pasted the same paragraph across 50 pages. Then Google updated its algorithm, and suddenly,\u00a0*originality*\u00a0and\u00a0*helpfulness*\u00a0became ranking factors.\n\nNow, we\u2019re doing the same thing with AI content. We are faking originality. Yes, I\u2019ll say it again: We are FAKING. ORIGINALITY.\n\nPeople prompt LLMs to add \u201cnatural flaws\u201d or mess up the structure, just like we used to stuff meta descriptions with gibberish. It\u2019s SEO 2010 all over again. Except this time, we\u2019re optimizing to\u00a0*not look optimized*.\n\n# But Who\u2019s Actually Winning?\n\nThe rise of Reddit, Substack, and the enduring trust in Wikipedia (as\u00a0Elena Verna\u00a0pointed out in one of her newsletters) tells us something:\n\nPeople want real voices. Not recycled content. Not AI-flavored filler. Not copy-paste insights.\n\nThe folks most excited about\u00a0copy.ai, Jasper, or the early days of ChatGPT? Often those who lacked confidence in their writing. And that\u2019s okay \u2014 AI felt liberating.\n\nBut the flip side is a content landfill. Shallow. Repetitive. Styleless.\n\n# Here\u2019s What I Do (And What I Won\u2019t Do)\n\nI use LLMs every day. To rephrase, explore tone, tighten intros. But the ideas? The structure? The examples and arguments? All mine.\n\nWhen I write technical content for companies, it\u2019s the experts\u2019 brains doing the heavy lifting. AI is a polish, not a pen.\n\nWhy? Because I don\u2019t want to flood the internet with another \u201c10 tips on using AI in your business\u201d post.\n\nI want to add something. And if I don\u2019t have anything original to say? I\u2019d rather stay quiet.\n\n# On Agents, Prompts, and Real Marketing\n\nYes, I\u2019ve tested the full \u201cAI marketing agent\u201d stack \u2014 brief in, blog out, podcast clip generated, landing page written.\n\nImpressive? Sure. Useful? Sometimes. Sufficient for professional services and complex positioning? Still too shallow.\n\nGreat marketing, like great filmmaking, is made in the edit. In the decisions. In the cuts, not just the footage.\n\nReal writing is rewriting. Selecting. Deleting. Crafting tone \u2014 not just pumping out volume.\n\n# Let\u2019s Not Die Empty\n\nHere\u2019s what I care about most.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live in a world where we create brilliant business ideas \u2014 and present them in dull, generic, lifeless language. Where tone, voice, and rhythm vanish. Where we don\u2019t admire a sentence the way we admire a melody.\n\nI still read\u00a0*The New Yorker*\u00a0and\u00a0*The Economist*\u00a0\u2014 not just for information, but for\u00a0*style*. For\u00a0*boldness*. For\u00a0*voice*.\n\nBecause if we replace creativity with recycling, it won\u2019t be long before AI hires\u00a0*us*\u00a0to write with style and originality.\n\nBecause we\u2019ve lost that muscle.\n\nLet\u2019s not let that happen.\n\nLet\u2019s use AI to augment creativity \u2014 not fake it. Let\u2019s keep the weird dashes and the real ideas. Let\u2019s stay human.\n\nSeriously.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nK.",

They try GEO as an alternative to get some traffic. As a result, post optimization they are able to get some traffic because AI engines doesn\u2019t work the way traditional Google Search works. Hence, a pro-GEO stand. \n\nIn my opinion, as AI engines refer only 30% of the total links it refers from the first SERP.

    "title":"12 hours with ChatGPT Agent: What do agents mean for b2b marketing?",
    "text":"OpenAI launched \"ChatGPT Agent\" last night (UK time). **Short story:** It can use its own computer. And they trained it to be really good at creating PowerPoint slides for you.\n\n**Long story....**\n\nIt combines the best bits of Operator (which I have long championed), Deep Research, o3, and the ChatGPT interface. It can run for 30-40mins on complex tasks using a range of tools to get a job done. Those tools include a web browser, image generator, deep research, and writing code. It uses the existing data connectors to grab content from your own web apps (SharePoint, Teams, Google Drive, Github etc..) to work with your tools.\n\nBut what does it mean for b2b marketing? Well in short EVERYTHING\n\n*This post is aimed at marketing teams, departments or agencies (I run an agency focused on b2b marketing).*\n\nChatGPT Agent is the latest in a trend of AI products with 2 key features. First they have tools. That means they can do a bunch of different things (and they choose themselves when and how to use them). Two of these tools are searching the web and writing the code. These open up a huge number of sub capabilities. The second key feature is the ability to work for an extended period of time \"on their own\". Combined this means this sort of AI product can be given a fairly complex task and be left to do it. By go to example for b2b marketing.... putting together the monthly social media report for a wider team or the board. It normally looks a bit like this:\n\n* Login to LinkedIn and note down the data in Word\n* Do the same in X, or use a third party tool you connected to it\n* Do the same in Instagram or any other platform you need\n* You've already lost an hour\n* Then login to Google Analytics to grab relevant website data\n* This is an hour by itself, GA is a nightmare I think\n* Then you've got a load of numbers, time to fight with PowerPoint to make a deck\n* Spend 3hrs doing this, trying to keep it all on brand\n* Finish and make coffee to celebrate\n* Remember you have forgotten to add any insights, go back and do that\n* You've spent all day on it now.\n* Finish up by emailing it to the team, and wait for the 100 questions by return email\n\nChatGPT Agent can do this whole process for you.   \n\n\nI have been testing it with this sort of task:\n\n>\"We are running an set of SEO emails in MailChimp, an automation. I think we have sent 5 of 10 or so. Can you review their performance and give me a slide I can present to the Leadership Team to show how they doing. They for leadgen ultimately, so any insights would be great.\"\n\n **The results?**  \n\n* The cover slide is terrible.  \n* The data on slide 2 is correct though, they have pulled out the correct numbers.  \n* And the accompanying text is helpful, if not super insightful.  \n* But they haven't really given me any info on the leadgen aspect.   \n* I can't use this internally, and certainly this isn't work fit for a client.   \n\nBut here is the rub. This new tech runs it's own computer, has access to any webapp I give it (and sign into), can write code, generate slides, use Excel, and operate on its own on complex tasks for 30-40mins. These slides took 19 minutes. \n\nSo yes this is basic intern work right now. And it needs to be better. Yes it is slow. Yes it needs hand holding. \n\nBut guess what? All real interns need that. And they are still out there in the real world doing valuable work. And so can ChatGPT Agent. \n\nAnd like a real intern it will get better at work, smarter and faster.\n\nBut unlike any human worker, soon it will get really really smart, really really fast, able to work 24\/7, and never get tired or sick or complain.   It won't do it lightening quick right now. It will ask you for a nudge along the way, and the deck won't be perfect (but will be better than 50% of people who make terrible decks for a living). But it will work. And it can chug away in the background why you do something else.\n\nAnd this is one use case. There are 100s of others:\n\n* Drafting campaign performance reports from multiple platforms\n* Updating buyer personas or ICP docs using CRM and call data\n* Creating competitor intelligence summaries from online sources\n* Rewriting landing pages for different personas\n* Pulling proof points for case studies or sales pitches from internal docs\n\nThere is a lot of hype around AI (duh!) but one thing as far as I can see is 100% the WAY we work is changing. Normal office workers need to skill up and learn how and why they can command an army of agents to do 70% of their day to day, and what that means for their now free time?\n\nAgain this is NOT about AI replacing humans. This is about what humans will be capable of when equipped with AI. Look at your job now. List the 10 most tedious things you do every week in your project management tools, or CRM, or your timesheet, or reporting tasks. Fire up a couple of instances of ChatGPT Agent, and get back to doing something that really moves the needle in your role. ",

If you do, I'd love to hear about the tools you find most helpful, especially any AI-specific ones. If not, could you share why that is?\n\nIn today's digital age, it's essential to stay updated with the latest marketing trends and platforms, and Reddit can be a powerful tool when used effectively. Its diverse communities offer unique opportunities for targeted advertising and engagement. However, I've noticed that some marketers might not fully leverage Reddit due to various reasons.\n\nFor those who do use Reddit for marketing, I'm particularly interested in learning about the AI tools you find most beneficial. These could range from content creation tools to AI-powered analytics platforms. Understanding how fellow marketers approach this platform can provide valuable insights and potentially inspire new strategies for all of us.\n\nOn the flip side, if you don't use Reddit as part of your marketing mix, I'd love to hear about any challenges or reservations that led you to make that decision. Your experiences can help shape the wider conversation about the role of AI in digital marketing on this platform.\n\nLet's share our insights and learn from each other!

    "title":"Need help getting clients and having a good payment model",
    "text":"Hello Reddit,\n\nI\u2019m currently stuck and could use some advice. I just started a business called Elite Marketing Group. I recently secured a free internship with a fintech SaaS company called AskApe.ai after meeting the founder at a cafe. It\u2019s unpaid, but it gives me access to tools like ChatGPT Pro and Claude for free, which I\u2019m grateful for, plus I\u2019ll get some good experience. That said, fintech isn\u2019t the space I really want to work in.\n\nWhat I\u2019m really passionate about is creating content for real estate agents and high-end restaurants. I have a DJI Avata 2 drone that shoots beautiful, high-quality videos, and I use an iPhone 15 Plus. I use the drone for a lot of my footage. One of my TikTok drone videos hit 120k views, so I know there\u2019s potential. I edit mostly with CapCut, and I use Photoshop for graphic design work. I\u2019m also decent with Canva, just starting to get into Lightroom, and I know a bit of Python that I\u2019m hoping to apply somehow down the line.\n\nThe services I offer include content creation, social media management (I\u2019m good with engagement, writing captions, and making viral content), graphic design (Photoshop, Canva, and AI tools), and photo\/video editing. I\u2019m still learning and improving, but I feel confident in what I bring to the table.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is finding paying clients and figuring out a good payment model. I\u2019ve tried cold calling, but I\u2019ve been told I come across as spammy, which definitely isn\u2019t what I want. I\u2019m open to doing initial work at a discount or even free if there\u2019s long-term potential, but I just need a way to turn interest into consistent income.\n\nIf anyone has advice, tips, or even some work opportunities they\u2019d be willing to throw my way, I\u2019d really appreciate it. I can DM you a link to my site or portfolio if you want to check out what I\u2019ve done.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTLDR\nStarted a creative agency and landed a fintech internship that gives me free AI tools. I want to work with real estate agents and restaurants instead. I have solid gear and content that\u2019s gone viral, but I\u2019m struggling to get clients and figure out a solid payment model. Any advice or leads would mean a lot.",

    "text":"A team of five, a bunch of meetings, and \u20ac5,000\/month to post three carousels. Sound familiar? Let's face it, the traditional model is (and has been for a while) broken. And honestly, it's not because of the individual agencies or the people. It's because the world has changed, and the agency model hasn't. \n\nOver the last few years, I've been talking daily with agency owners, social media marketers, project managers, account managers, copywriters, designers,...basically with the full 'value chain' of the traditional model, and they all say the same in some shape or form:\n\n* The model is completely outdated (because of AI), but it's still making enough money (for now). \n* Going 'core AI' would cannibalize their own business so hard that it might end it.\n\nNot necessarily intrinsic motivation for self-inflicted disruption, right \ud83d\ude09. \n\n# So what's wrong with the current SMM business model? \n\nWhen social media was new, agencies made sense. You needed experts, designers, planners, someone who knew the platforms. But fast forward to 2025, and here\u2019s what we see:\n\n* Clients waiting weeks for a handful of posts\n* \u20ac3K\u2013\u20ac10K monthly retainers for work that could be semi-automated\n* Endless rounds of feedback, strategy docs no one reads\n* Content that\u2019s generic, slow, and disconnected from real-time trends\n* A growing dependence on external teams to speak on your behalf\n* Burned-out social media managers in agencies\n* No personality, no authenticity, no connection\n\nMeanwhile, AI tools are exploding. In-house teams are getting smarter. **Every client wants more ownership, speed, and control.** Agencies? They\u2019re still stuck in 2017.\n\n# It's time for a new model for a new era\n\nThe 'billable hour, paying for input' model was already utterly flawed before AI came around. Yet there was no real alternative for the agency model. AND for some businesses working with an agency also meant getting access to expertise and not having to hire someone. \n\nAI really hit marketing as a domain front and center. It started with the production side of marketing (creating content), and quickly (not slowly) moved to more tactical and strategic parts too (content calendars, content strategy). Now that AI agents (agency vs. agents; not a coincidence) are becoming new virtual colleagues, the real displacement is happening. \n\nThese agents represent the **new model**. A model that helps busy teams and individuals do social media themselves. Fast, on-brand, and consistent. No endless back-and-forth. No retainers. No delay. Just real results, created in minutes, by you and your agents. Not by your agency. Here's what's happening already today:\n\n* Content strategy that evolves with the business all the time\n* Content calendars that get updated based on insights and analytics\n* Posts that get generated in your tone of voice for company and personal profiles\n* AI and automation that do 80% of the heavy lifting and repetitive work\n* Coaching by real domain experts when you need it. Autonomy when you don\u2019t.\n* Always on, always available assistance whenever you need it, wherever you are\n* No bottlenecks. No meetings. No friction because of process or people. \n\n# Time to choose and set yourself up for the future\n\nIn 2025, *everyone* is a media company. And you can\u2019t outsource your story. This isn\u2019t about replacing people. It\u2019s about replacing a way of thinking - that someone else should \u201chandle\u201d your voice online. They really shouldn't anymore. \n\nSo you can spend another quarter writing briefs, hopping on agency Zoom calls, and wondering why nothing is working.\n\nOR\n\nYou can join the post-agency era. where content gets created, shared, and amplified\u2026 without middlemen.\n\nAnd honestly? You shouldn\u2019t be paying the price for a system that takes your time, your money, and your momentum - without delivering in return.\n\nWe\u2019re at the edge of a massive shift, and those who move now will be the ones who lead tomorrow. Don\u2019t wait for Q4 panic or a competitor to show up in your feed with a smarter, faster content engine. Use this summer to rethink how you do social media. Audit your current setup. Cut the dead weight. Experiment. Build your new rhythm that actually matches the speed of 2025 and beyond. \n\nThought, impressions, reactions, experiences, disagreements are super welcome!   \n",

I gained interest initially by helping local small businesses make websites, flyers etc. My peers kept telling me to go into marketing and well once I was laid off I dove in. \n\nCurrently I have one client on a monthly retainer which is\u2026 rough.

I spend  lot of time trying to make everything absolutely perfect. \n\nOverall, I\u2019ve got decent recognition for being sort of new, in ranking at 9 in my area on Google without any ads. \n\nBut.. the leads are none. I do pitch to small companies after I\u2019ve done research and cross reference how my services could help them. I also go out in person with little gift bags of my flyers, brochures, tips for small businesses and a snippet on questions to ask marketers as well as a personalized and tailored card to the business. \n\nIt sounds insane I know to do all this by myself but I love working.

    "text":"I have read a lot of successful stories on Digital marketing agencies and how fast they could grow. But I still don\u2019t understand how do you get in to this?  And more importantly, what exactly specifically is they do, and who they help? It\u2019s very broad.\n\nI am a little knowledgeable in creating a campaigns on Instagram and Amazon, and I would describe myself as amateur. Like someone who had a chance to fool around with some small business ideas and create barely successful adds with my own products that eventually I stopped because it wasn\u2019t worth my time. And I think I can quickly figure out how to create campaigns on different platforms. And that led me to think maybe I quickly can get into digital marketing business\u2026 Currently I work in car sales and at a point  that I am sure I can build great relationships, rapport with people and sell myself. And I understand that I want to genuinely help people no matter what I am selling. But what kind of people are usually agencies helping? What niche is good right now? Is it better to just focus on one specific thing? \n\nI was thinking about creating a software using AI that helps health practices organize communication with new clients, respond to messages, navigate and set up appointments. Kinda like CRM? But it isn\u2019t really a digital marketing though? Or maybe help people like physical therapists, food catering businesses, other service providers find new clients? But I probably also need to help them handle and organize clientelle that I find for them, isn\u2019t that how it works? Like customer service, communication response etc. Thats why I am confused. \n\nAlso where do I find leads that my clients need? Can I just launch bunch of targeted instagram campaigns? Or can I find leads through other providers? Do I just resell them to my clients? Is that how it works? And once I submit people I found for my clients, do I just let them handle leads, or do I try to sell their services myself to the same leads that I found\u2026\n\n\nThats all assuming I already created a shell of my brand like LLC, Website, social media pages and etc. Which I didn\u2019t even start (except for llc which I have from previous failed business).\n\nLets say I got my first client, and they put in order, I run a successful instagram\/facebook ad that will find new clients, then question is how do I charge my client? For every appointment, or lead that came through? And again do agencies usually do anything else than create a mine a list of people who maybe interested in client services? Or are digital agencies are more in creative business like creating ad videos, marketing materials, brochures etc? So do I need to buy camera, graphics design software etc? \nSo I don\u2019t even understand what to even focus on in this \u201cDIGITAL MARKETING AGENCY\u201d umbrella because I can\u2019t seem to get what y\u2019all do\u2026 because my assumption is even though you all who own a business with the same name do completely different things from each other\u2026 creating ad campaings, or ad materials? Or creating software for clients, and integrating your own lead pipeline into that software, maybe that? \nAnd how do I even find people that need my help? Do I just go around my town and try to find them? So many questions and my head feels so disorganized, I don\u2019t even know where to start because I feel paralized by the options. Anyone else without experience also feels the same way? ",

Here are five that have made a noticeable difference in my workflow:\n\n1. Cloud Campaign \u2013 This has been a solid solution for managing social media, especially across multiple brands or clients. It covers scheduling, recycling older posts, caption writing with an AI assistant, analytics, and even connects with Zapier for more complex automation. It\u2019s built for teams, but still works well for solo users handling a lot of content.\n\n2. ActiveCampaign \u2013 Great for email automation and CRM. I use it to set up automated workflows, manage contact lists, and send targeted campaigns. It integrates easily with platforms like Shopify and WordPress, which makes life easier.\n\n3. BigSpy \u2013 Super helpful for ad research. It lets you monitor what competitors are running on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It\u2019s a good way to stay inspired and keep an eye on trends.\n\n4. VDraw \u2013 A lightweight tool that turns text into infographics. It\u2019s not a full design suite, but it\u2019s fast and gets the job done when I need quick visuals for social or blog content.\n\n5. Taboola\u2019s Abby \u2013 An AI assistant for creating ad copy and picking visuals. It\u2019s not flawless, but it helps speed things up when building campaigns, especially if you're short on time or resources.\n\nThese tools each solve different problems, and together they've helped me cut down on repetitive work.

    "title":"Work life balance -spouse perspective",
    "text":"I\u2019m the spouse of a digital marketing professional.   A little over a year ago my spouses company decided to post on TT and insta daily. They post twice daily normally. \n\nThis was a bit of change for me as a spouse and I\u2019ve been struggling with meaningful connection with my spouse since.  I\u2019m struggling with never being able to turn work off. My spouse doesn\u2019t understand why it impacts me as I\u2019m not the one having to post. However, the disconnection occurs because in moments that used to be filled with conversations or listening to music in the car etc are now filled with posting while we are driving or out, in between free moments,or late at night when you should be having pillow talk. My spouse doesn\u2019t understand why it upsets me and tries to do it quickly, but there always seems to be issues. Some sound doesn\u2019t work, a graphic is cutoff etc. What should be 30 minutes turns into 3 hours, though it is off and on\u2026not three hours constant. My spouse texts the team, they decide what to do. It has to be approved, then the post finally happens and you have to wait for it to upload and move onto the next platform. \n\nI also have an extremely demanding job, though I try to not let it spill over into the weekends or nights. It certainly does sometimes, but it has becomes the exception or a true emergency. With the daily posting, I feel like even though we are together, my spouse is not present. I can\u2019t express the joy in dumping 250 on a steak dinner and her team texting during dinner which elicits a response and back and forth to deal with some comment or issue. \n\nI thought it would get better as I was told eventually they\u2019d be able to schedule them. Apparently their numbers drop when they do and my spouses boss called them out on that. So my spouse manually posts, then interacts with the app after posting to help the algorithm and show engagement. Meanwhile I hear videos rewind, as my spouse tweaks the AI captioning and moves things around. \n\nMy spouse says it is a 24\/7\/365 job. Surgeons do not work this much. I\u2019m so tired of the constant attention social media gets. Both of my kids complain but they are too scared to address it with my spouse and just tell me every so often, though I don\u2019t think it impacts them as much as myself. I feel like every free moment is spent trying to tweak things or answer coworkers or comments in every down moment (go walk the dog\u2014aka so you don\u2019t see me responding to posts).  Extra long bathroom breaks, doom scrolling. It has gotten to the point that even if that is not what\u2019s happening, my mind thinks it is. Then before bed my spouse unwinds by scrolling FB and news. \n\nMy soul is screaming for connection and my spouse doesn\u2019t understand what the big deal is. In my spouses mind we are with each other and it is just posting so what is the big deal. I asked to be able to take vacations without posting and was told it wasn\u2019t possible. I\u2019d really love to have one day a week with zero SM. \n\nCan someone provide me with some perspective from those in the field. I feel like it is reasonable to be able to disconnect for one day a week. If it is how do you accomplish it? How do I address it?  I\u2019m tired of waking up in the middle of the night feeling of such despair that the rest of my life is going to be like this. ",

Use AI to strengthen your audience feedback loop and run surveys. Get clients feedback, analyze sales calls, listen to social media, analyze reviews...\n\n\n\n6. If possible, build an offer portfolio to increase your clients retention and LTV. Stay known for one signature offer but stack revenue\n\n\n\n7. Control your positioning by keeping a consistent messaging strategy across channels and also across time.

    "text":"Happy Monday! We\u2019ve rounded up the top AI updates from last week, perfect fuel for your marketing strategy this week. Let\u2019s dive in and see what\u2019s worth applying:\n\n* **Brodie Clark:** ***\u201cBased on my experiment, I do believe that AI Mode data is now showing in Search Console\u201d***\n\nBrodie Clark recently analyzed the latest changes in Google Search\u2014focusing on AI Mode, AI Overviews, and how they compare to traditional search results. In his new study, titled \"AI Mode Tracking in Google Search Console Confirmed \\[SEO Experiment\\]\", he shared several key insights and followed up on social media with a summary of the most valuable takeaways:\n\n*Average position in Google's AI Mode takes more of a sharp-left compared to the zig-zag of a traditional search results page.*\n\n*This approach tends to be more simplified in mobile search results (where the sequence is clear), with there being rules put in place for desktop that complicate data interpretation.*\n\n*The major distinguishing feature of AI Mode is the primary sources featured on the right, which may lead some to follow Google's zig-zag approach to average position \u2013 because this is what is referenced in their docs.*\n\n*Search results have evolved quite a bit since many of these position calculation rules were put in place, with AI Overviews within the main tab of Search essentially matching that of AI Mode by featuring multiple visible citations by default that record the same position.*\n\n*All of this aside, the major difference is in what the \"10-blue-links\" equivalent is. Taking Google's docs into account, depending on whether it is a dotted underline (which is different) or not, then this would essentially take on its own position with the data.*\n\n*Does this make sense? Probably not. Because position 3 in traditional results would likely have a reasonable CTR. Within AI Mode? That same position 3 is less important within the context of the page and less prominent, so clicks are going to be far lower.*\n\n*So without any filter for AI Mode itself in Search Console, we're left with mixing 2 completely different datasets into one. But with how much a \"traditional\" search results page has changed in recent years, this has effectively been happening for even longer.*\n\n**Source:**\n\nBrodie Clark | Blog, X\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n* **Google adds troubleshooting tips on blocking content from AI Mode & AI Overviews**\n\nBarry Schwartz is dropping some major insights for SEOs. Google quietly revised its AI-features help documentation\u2014released less than a month ago\u2014by adding a section on troubleshooting preview controls. In short, if you want to keep your pages out of AI Overviews, AI Mode, or other AI features, these steps will help.\n\nThe new section states:\n\n*If you implemented preview controls and you're still seeing your content appear in AI features on Search, try the following steps:*\n\n*1) Make sure that the preview control is correct and visible to Googlebot. To test if your implementation is correct, use the URL Inspection tool to see the HTML that Googlebot received while crawling the page.*\n\n*2) Allow time for Google to recrawl and process the change in preview controls. Remember that crawling can take anywhere from several days to several months, depending on how often our systems determine a page needs to be refreshed. If you've made changes, you can request that Google recrawl your pages.*\n\n**Sources:**\n\nBarry Schwartz | Search Engine Roundtable\n\nGoogle Search Central\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n* **The SEO community continues to discuss Sundar Pichai's interview**\n\nHere are the main points:\n\n* **Google reiterates its commitment to the open web.** In a recent conversation with Lex Fridman, Pichai said Google **\u201cremains dedicated to supporting the broader web ecosystem,\u201d** even as new AI-powered features\u2014AI Overviews and AI Mode\u2014roll out.\n\n* **AI Overviews and AI Mode are meant to augment, not replace, human content.** Pichai explained that these tools provide extra context and prompt deeper exploration. He acknowledged publishers\u2019 worries about traffic loss but stressed that **news and journalism remain \u201cessential elements\u201d of Google\u2019s long-term vision.**\n\n* **Advertising will adapt once the organic AI experience is perfected.** For now, Google is refining AI Mode as a separate tab; **successful elements will migrate into the main results page later.** Pichai confirmed that ads will stay central to Google\u2019s model, just on an AI-ready timetable.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nLex Fridman | YouTube\n\nRoger Montti | SE Journal\n\nScott Shorter | X",

    "text":"The future of search arrived quietly this week. Google's AI Mode is now rolling out to every U.S. searcher, even those browsing incognito.  \n  \nThis isn't just another AI feature. AI Mode fundamentally rewrites how search works.  \n  \nInstead of showing you ten blue links, it deploys \"query fan-out\" system.  \n  \nThat means it fans your question out into multiple sub-queries across various sources, then stitches everything into comprehensive, reasoned answers.  \n  \nThink of it as having a research assistant who can instantly cross-reference dozens of sources while you wait.

    "text":"Hi friends! Our team never stops for a second\u2014we\u2019re constantly tracking the latest news for you. So let\u2019s dive in together and maybe adjust our strategies to match the shifting market.\n\n**Updates**\n\n* **Google\u2019s June 2025 core update rolls out globally over three weeks**\n\nGoogle officially began the June 2025 broad core update on June 30 and will likely complete it over the next three weeks. This update is classified as a \"regular update\" designed to surface relevant, satisfying content across all languages and regions. It follows previous core updates, including those in March, December, and beyond.\n\n**Source:**\u00a0\n\nGoogle Search Status Dashboard > Incidents\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Search\/SEO**\n\n* **Google's MUVERA algorithm improves semantic relevance in search**\n\nThe new MUVERA algorithm (Multi\u2011Vector Retrieval via Fixed-Dimensional Encodings) improves how search understands and ranks content. It speeds up retrieval and boosts accuracy by compressing complex multi-vector signals into efficient representations.\n\nHere\u2019s how SEOs should respond:\n\n* Focus on semantically rich, well-structured content.  \n* Optimize for intent-based, long-tail queries.  \n* Move beyond keyword-stuffing toward topic depth and clarity.\n\nMUVERA marks a shift toward smarter, more context-aware search.\n\n* **URL extensions don\u2019t affect SEO**\n\nJohn Mueller reaffirmed that choosing between using *.htm, .html,* or no extension in your URLs does not impact SEO.\u00a0\n\nHe explained that file extensions are purely historical. Extensions are irrelevant to Google\u2019s ranking algorithms, (this advice has held true for several years). Mueller also noted that while extensions don't matter, URL structure still impacts user experience, tracking, and site organization.\n\n**Source:**\n\nRoger Montti | Search Engine Land\n\nJohn Mueller | Reddit\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SERP features\/Interface**\n\n* **(test) \u201cPreferred Sources\u201d in Top Stories**\n\nGoogle is currently experimenting with a new Search Labs feature called Preferred Sources, located in the Top Stories carousel. Users in the U.S. and India can opt in via Labs, then mark their favorite publications by tapping a star icon next to the Top Stories results. Once selected, the user\u2019s starred sources will appear more prominently and frequently in their Top Stories feed.\n\n* **Google tests AI Mode button in Chrome\u2019s search bar on desktop & Android**\n\nTests have shown a new \u201cAI Mode\u201d button appearing directly in the Chrome address bar, on both desktop and Android, for users in the U.S. and India.\u00a0\n\n**Source:**\n\nGoogle The Keyword > Product > Search\n\nBarry Schwartz | Search Engine Roundtable\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**AIO\/AI Mode**\n\n* **AI Mode in Search Labs expands to India as part of global rollout**\n\nGoogle rolled out AI Mode in India as an experiment in Search Labs in English.

Properties must now work with an approved booking partner\u2014like a reservation system or third-party integration\u2014to appear in hotel listings.\n\nHotel rates that aren't managed by one of these partners will stop appearing in both search results and hotel ads. Google provided a list of certified partners to support this transition. The update also applies to free booking links. Hotel sites can still receive traffic at no cost if properly integrated.\n\n**Source:**\n\nBarry Schwartz | Search Engine Roundtable\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u00a0\n\n**Local SEO**\n\n* **Google Business Profiles now display social profiles above posts**\n\nGoogle updated Business Profile layouts to feature social media links prominently above the Google Posts section. This change brings social verification to the forefront and helps businesses showcase their broader online presence.\n\n* **\u201cPosting reviews is turned off for this place\u201d notice in Business Profiles**\n\nSome users have reported seeing a new message\u2014\u201cPosting reviews is turned off for this place\u201d on select Google Business Profiles. It bars them from leaving feedback or reviews.\u00a0\n\nThis typically appears for organizations that are unverified or restricted in some way, possibly to reduce spam or low-quality reviews.\u00a0\n\n* **Google disallows adding countries or states to service-area Business Profiles**\n\nGoogle updated its guidelines to prevent businesses from using entire countries or states as service-area entries on their Business Profiles. Previously, profiles could list large regions (e.g. spanning 19 countries), but the revised policy mandates service areas stay within a two\u2011hour driving radius of the business location.\n\n* **Offerwall now live in Business Profiles**\n\nThe new offerwall feature in Google Business Profiles showcases deals and promotions directly beneath business information. SEOs and local marketers should note this addition because it boosts visibility and conversions for businesses offering special promotions.\n\n* **Google Merchant Center product status change history report returns**\n\nMerchant Center has reinstated the Product Status Changes history report, a previously moved feature now visible by default within the \u201cProducts\u201d section. The report logs past status updates to help merchants see their product data flow better.\n\n**Source:**\n\nSyed M.

No need to drag it out, so here we go:\n\n**AIO\/AI Mode**\n\n* **AI\u202fMode rolls out in the U.S., set to join core Google Search experience**\n\nAI Mode has officially rolled out in the U.S., now available even for users browsing incognito or without signing in\u2014no need to opt in via Search Labs.

He explained that having \u201ca lot of totally unrelated content on the site\u201d (e.g., targeting random, unrelated keywords) can confuse both search engines and users.\n\nMueller advised site owners to consider whether this off-topic content was intentional and to clean it up or separate distinct topics. A clear thematic focus helps search engines understand a site\u2019s relevance and prevents ranking losses caused by mixed content.\n\n* **Google eases opposition to AI-powered page translation**\n\nA recent update reveals a shift in Google\u2019s stance on automated translation: sites using AI to translate content are now more likely to benefit from regional traffic rather than be penalized. This change follows Google\u2019s approval of Reddit\u2019s own use of AI translation.\n\nAdditionally, Google has removed some translation-related penalties it enforced in the past, making it easier for publishers to reach new audiences through AI-generated multilingual content.\n\n**Source:**\n\nBarry Schwartz | Search Engine Roundtable\n\nJohn Mueller | bsky\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**SERP features \/ Interface**\n\n* **(test) Product tags appear in Google Local Photos carousel**\n\nRecently, Google started testing product tags within Local Photos carousels, overlaying tags on images in the \u2018Explore photos\u2019 unit.

These longer, natural-language queries are mixed with standard keyword data.\n\nTo address this, some SEO professionals have started experimenting with their own detection methods and have shared a few useful patterns that may help identify AI-style queries. Suggestions include filtering queries by word count and by interrogative keywords such as *what, why, when, how, where, which, can, could, should, do, does, is, are, will, who, whom,* and *whose.*\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that this approach is **not** an official solution from Google.\n\n**Source:**\n\nMetehan Yesilyurt | X\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Documentation**\n\n* **Google softens policy on removal-based ranking penalties**\n\nGoogle updated its \u2019Removal-Based Demotion Systems\u2019 guidance, changing the wording from \u201chigh volume\u201d to \u201csignificant volume\u201d of removal requests\u2014such as copyright take-downs or personal data removals\u2014that can trigger ranking penalties. The emphasis now is on the relative impact of removal requests, not just the absolute number.\u00a0\n\nAs John Mueller explained, *\u201cIt\u2019s basically just clarifying that it\u2019s not the absolute number but rather the significance.\u201d*\n\n**Sources:**\n\nGoogle Search Central > Blog\n\nJohn Mueller | bsky\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Tech SEO**\n\n* **Google drops support for seven rare structured data types**\n\nGoogle is phasing out support for seven rarely used structured-data markups as part of its effort to \u201csimplify the search results page.\u201d These features don\u2019t offer significant value and aren\u2019t widely used, so their removal should make search results cleaner and more focused.\n\nNote that support for more popular markup types, such as the recently introduced loyalty pricing markup, remains intact.\n\n* **Loyalty and membership program markup now supported in search results**\n\nGoogle has introduced structured data support for loyalty and membership programs, allowing businesses to highlight special pricing in search results. This feature can now be implemented via Organization and Product schema markup, ensuring loyalty benefits appear directly in search snippets.\n\nBusinesses already using Merchant Center can continue defining loyalty offerings there, while others can add the markup directly on-site.

Not trying to hard sell, but if anyone wants to check it out and give feedback, I\u2019d appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f\n\nCurious what other SEO\/AI combos people here are trying? I\u2019m always testing!\n",
